## Setting up the app

Clone the repo.  

Make sure you have python3.10 installed. If not, run: `$ brew install python@3.10`  

`$ source .env/bin/activate`  
`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`  


## Running the app

To start your servers:  
`$ cd src`  
`$ python manage.py runserver` to run the django server.  

Open a new tab, make sure you are in `src/` then:  
`$ python manage.py tailwind start`  

Enjoy the headaches 😁
